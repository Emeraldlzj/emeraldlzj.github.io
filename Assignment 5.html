    <p>For years, people had rolled eyes at news headlines on Facebook, Twitter and many other social networks. Inevitably, mainstream medias started to market their articles for clicks, shares and an ever-dwindling piece of the advertising-revenue pie. But lately, some more questionable outlets have started appearing in feeds, mimicking the attention-starved style, and even fishing real news organizations to broadcast their feeds. These questionable outlets including 100percentfedup.com, USA Supreme, DailyOccupation and so on. <br/><br/>
      The following data consists of 430 unreliable media sites, whose Google hit, Facebook likes and Twitter posts were counted, and political alignment and sites’ characters were categorized. All data was grabbed on Facebook Graph API from January1, 2014 to December 31, 2016. Besides, it plays a cardinal role in a report called “Diving deep into Clickbaits: Who use them to what extents in which topics with what effects”, which was released at an International Conference on advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining(ASONAM) in Sydney, Australia. <br/><br/>
